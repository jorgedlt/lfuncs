Linux flavored BASH functions for casual CLI

A practical Bash utility pack for Ubuntu 24.04 that replaces macOS specific behavior with Linux ready commands. It includes fast YAML and JSON inspectors, note and TODO search, clipboard and text shaping helpers, date and time converters, simple networking math, file dumpers for reviews, and small quality of life wrappers for Git, Terraform, and Terragrunt. Sensible auto detection picks Wayland or X11 clipboards, with clear fallbacks. Drop the script in your home directory, source it from .bashrc, and use the grouped functions as focused, composable tools in everyday workflows.
